In this file, we will go through the required steps to perform to run this program smoothly.
1. Open your terminal and verify with the command python --version, that your python version is up to date and if not install python or the newer version.
2. For this project, we have worked with two different IDEs (Pycharm, VS code). Please make sure your IDE can run the code.
3. We have worked with different libraries that required different modules. If you run the program in your IDE it is possible that some of these libraries are not installed. Here are some modules we have installed and were required to run this program.
4. Make sure that your pip is install and has the correct version. This can be found in the terminal.
5. The first library to install is numpy. In the terminal you will enter the command: pip install numpy. This command works for both Windows and Mac users.
6. The second library to install is pandas. In the terminal you will enter the command: pip install pandas. This command works for both Windows and Mac users.
7. The third library to install is pandas. In the terminal you will enter the command: pip install scikit-learn. This command works for both Windows and Mac users.
8. The final library to install is matplotlib. In the terminal you will enter the command: pip install matplotlib. This command works for both Windows and Mac users.
9. It is also possible that you will have to install: pip install scipy as one of our teammates needed it.
10. For some of these libraries, a simple update may do the trick. Therefore, use the command pip upgrade "library_name". 
11. If you follow all these steps, you will be able to run the main.py file which run all three classifiers, plotting and the display of the results.
